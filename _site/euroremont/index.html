      <p class="loud">This is a research project which aims to reveal the Ukrainian identity and explain colonial influence of Сultures of West and East through housing.</p>

      <p>It has been 30 years since Ukraine gained independence from imperial influence, and "Euroremont" has emerged as a prevalent trend in modern residential architecture. Although it is not recognized as a distinct style or methodology, the term is widely understood and accepted by the public throughout the country. "Euro renovation" originated in the mid-90s within the construction industry, where contractors would encourage buyers to invest in "Euro-standard" materials and solutions, using the prefix "Euro" as a symbol of quality.</p>
      <p>The term "Euro renovation" gained popularity in the mid-90s as wealthier individuals began to have access to new, post-Soviet (and postcolonial) services such as "turnkey flats" and "Euro renovation." As time passed and we entered the 2000s, the concept of "Euro renovation" became more accessible to the general public. It reached its peak a decade later when almost everyone who was renovating their homes used at least a few techniques, such as stretch ceilings in the kitchen or plasterboard waves on the bedroom ceiling.</p>
